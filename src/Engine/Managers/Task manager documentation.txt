Task manager documentation

Threads can be in two states: Active and Inactive. While Active a thread can be running or idle.

Like a car, it can be off or on, and while on, it can be stopped or in circulation.


Main process: Called by main thread. wakes up all worker threads and puts itself to sleep until all worker threads are sleeping

init thread loop:Shortcut for Threadpool::initThread with loop as function

addTask & addTaskList: adds tasks to the queue and wakes up any idle threads

callTask: retrieves task from queue. If queue is empty, dispatches an phony task and marks itself idle markThreadIdle

idleThread: waits for CV to be unlocked and the thread be marked active

markThreadIdle: marks the status of a thread to idle if it isnt

signalAllIdle: If all threads are marked idle, signals main to proceed

markThreadRunning: marks thread to be running if it isnt

markAllRunning: calls markThreadRunning for every thread

beginCycle: marks all threads running markAllRunning and wakes them up from the condition variable

wakeUpandJoinThread: sets thread status to inactive. Makes it running and wakes it from the CV. The joins it.

wakeUpandStopAll:Gets all threads out of the loop
